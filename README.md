<h3>Extreme Prank Makeover for your website on April Fools</h3>

---

<h4>Ever wanted to reveal your website in style? Like that classy American show used to?</h4>

Movethatbus.js creates an overlaying canvas with a bus, when clicked, it "moves the bus" and plays some fitting sound.<br/>
Use for your next website reveal, as an april fools joke or just go crazy and use it on every visit!<br/>
You can restrict it to only trigger within a certain date range or for visitors that have a special cookie set.<br/>
Have fun, but maybe not too much fun.

This package is made without dependencies for you to easily include and initialize it in your project.

[See the DEMO](https://knogobert.github.io/movethatbus.js/demo.html)

[See the DEMO with "1st April 2020 only" settings](https://knogobert.github.io/movethatbus.js/demo-dates.html)

[See the DEMO with visitorsCookie settings](https://knogobert.github.io/movethatbus.js/demo-cookies.html)

## Install

```
npm install --save movethatbus.js
```

or

```
yarn install movethatbus.js
```

## Usage

### How to include

The script needs to be imported/included/required in your project before it can be initialized.

#### If you use ES6
```js
import moveThatBus from 'movethatbus.js'
```

#### If you donâ€™t use ES6/donâ€™t know
Append the file in a script tag just before the `</body>` tag, like:
```js
<script src="lib/movethatbus.js"></script>
```

### How to initialize

#### If you use ES6
Run the method init when/after DOM is mounted
```js
moveThatBus.init();
```

#### If you donâ€™t use ES6/donâ€™t know
The script can be initialized by adding a simple `data-movethatbus` attribute to any HTML element.

*Initialization example:*
```html
<body data-movethatbus>
```
[See the DEMO](https://knogobert.github.io/movethatbus.js/demo.html)

If you only want to prank certain visitors, `init()` with the setting `visitorsCookie` with whatever name you want for your cookie. Then make sure that the chosen visitors have that cookie set to `true`.

### How to use Settings

```js
{
  cdnUrl: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knogobert/movethatbus.js/master/',
  busSrc: "lib/img/bus.png",
  soundSrcs: ["lib/sound/likeabus.mp3", "lib/sound/movethatbus.mp3", "lib/sound/engine.m4a"],
  amountOfTimesToLetBusLoad: 1, // compares to clickedCookie
  clickedCookie: 'howManyTimesDidYouMoveThatBus', // name of cookie
  visitorsCookie: false, // set to false to prank every visitor, or use string as the name for the cookie
  startDate: "", // MM/DD/YYYY = 04/01/2020. Set to first day that should trigger bus
  endDate: "", // MM/DD/YYYY = 04/02/2020. Set to *the day after* the last day that should trigger bus
}
```

#### If you use ES6
```js
moveThatBus.init({ visitorsCookie: 'youShouldMoveThatBus' });
// or
moveThatBus.init({ startDate: "04/01/2020", endDate: "04/02/2020" }); // For april fools only
```

#### If you donâ€™t use ES6/donâ€™t know
To be able to parse the setting keys and strings, surround them with single-quotes when using as value for data-movethatbus.

*Settings example:*
```html
<body data-movethatbus="{ 'visitorsCookie': 'youShouldMoveThatBus' }">
<!-- or -->
<main data-movethatbus="{ 'startDate': '04/01/2020', 'endDate': '04/02/2020' }"><!-- For april fools only -->
```
