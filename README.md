This package is made without dependencies for you to easily include and initialize it in your project.
It creates an overlaying canvas with a brumming bus, that triggers an animation with sound when clicked.

[See the DEMO](https://knogobert.github.io/movethatbus.js/demo.html)

[See the DEMO with settings](https://knogobert.github.io/movethatbus.js/demo-cookies.html)

## Install

```
npm install --save movethatbus.js
```

or

```
yarn install movethatbus.js
```

## Usage

### How to include

The script needs to be imported/included/required in your project before it can be initialized.

#### If you use ES6
```js
import moveThatBus from 'movethatbus.js'
```

#### If you donâ€™t use ES6/donâ€™t know
Append the file in a script tag just before the `</body>` tag, like:
```js
<script src="lib/movethatbus.js"></script>
```

### How to initialize

#### If you use ES6
Run the method init when/after DOM is mounted
```js
moveThatBus.init();
```

#### If you donâ€™t use ES6/donâ€™t know
The script can be initialized by adding a simple `data-movethatbus` attribute to any HTML element.

*Initialization example:*
```html
<body data-movethatbus>
```
[See the DEMO](https://knogobert.github.io/movethatbus.js/demo.html)

If you only want to prank certain visitors, `init()` with the setting `visitorsCookie` with whatever name you want for your cookie. Then make sure that the chosen visitors have that cookie set to `true`.

### How to use Settings

```js
{
  cdnUrl: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knogobert/movethatbus.js/master/',
  busSrc: "lib/img/bus.png",
  soundSrcs: ["lib/sound/likeabus.mp3", "lib/sound/movethatbus.mp3", "lib/sound/engine.m4a"],
  amountOfTimesToLetBusLoad: 1, // compares to clickedCookie
  clickedCookie: 'howManyTimesDidYouMoveThatBus', // name of cookie
  visitorsCookie: false, // set to false to prank every visitor, or use string as the name for the cookie
}
```

#### If you use ES6
```js
moveThatBus.init({ visitorsCookie: 'youShouldMoveThatBus' });
```

#### If you donâ€™t use ES6/donâ€™t know
To be able to parse the setting keys and strings, surround them with single-quotes when using as value for data-movethatbus.

*Settings example:*
```html
<body data-movethatbus="{ 'visitorsCookie': 'youShouldMoveThatBus' }">
```
